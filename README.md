My attempt to apply [jaungiers LSTM Neural Network](https://github.com/jaungiers/LSTM-Neural-Network-for-Time-Series-Prediction) to etherium prices in order to predict hstorical prices with a recurrent NN.

Historical Ethereum prices taken from etherscan.io and are current until December 27th 2017

Result
